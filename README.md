## Features
1. Loading data. 
    -Read TWO data files (JSON, CSV, Excel, etc.)
    I read in two CSV files. I created two separet queries on Kentucky State Police's website fo

2. Clean and operate on the data while combining them. The heart of data science is data wrangling and cleaning, so these features test that. This is where you would need to clean the set in order to merge them. 
    -Clean your data and perform a pandas merge with your two data sets, then calculate some new values based on the new data set.  
    Dropping columns and changing column names, Combine the sets EXPAND

3. Visualize / Present your data. 
    -Make a Tableau dashboard to display your data
    Here is a link to my profile to see all six vizulizations I made: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/mariah.corso

4. Best practices,
    -I created a virtual environment and was able to run my project through it after cloning my git hub repo. I have included instructions on how to run my project through a virtual environment. 

5.Interpretation of your data. 
   -Annotate your code with markdown cells in Jupyter Notebook, write clear code comments, and have a well-written README.md. 
    EXTREAME MARKDOWNS and a GREAT README
